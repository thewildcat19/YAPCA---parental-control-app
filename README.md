# YAPCA
It's a parental control app. The idea is that kids firstly should use educational apps first, only after that they can use their favorite games) And use it only in a safe amount of time.
I did it because when i searched for something like that, i couldn't find anything.It's my pet project, so i can't really support it, maybe just bug fixes and some small unrealised ideas.
Supports game and educational apps custom lists, limits to this apps, terminating game apps when game time has expired or education time not finished. Also has a control panel for watching stats and notification.
The Config file is in the same folder as exe, for now it's open, but i plan to use encryption. Default password is "123", you can change it in settings.Currently only 2 language.
